# AnnounceAce
AnnounceAce is a personalized Discord bot designed to reduce the burden of server management and communication. Its primary function is automating the scheduling and announcement process on Discord servers, making it a tool for system administrators. 

While I made this with student groups in mind, anyone running a discord server can likely find some use in this.

### Features
- Server-specific customization of bot name and profile photo.
  * So your announcements can still feel personal to your group, rather than just saying "insert_name_bot" 
- Automated, scheduled announcements with server-specific customization.
  * Saving the forgetful administrators of the world (eg. me)
- Easy access to group information, such as meeting times and contact info.
  * So your server users can see who to contact (if applicable) and when your meetings are 
  * Ideally, my goal is to have it so that when meeting information is given, you are prompted to schedule reminders about the meeting.
